# NETPRACTICE

## Description

**NetPractice** is a project designed to help you understand the fundamentals of computer networking.  
It focuses on concepts such as **IP addressing**, **subnetting**, and **routing**.

The goal is to fill in missing fields (IP addresses, subnet masks, routing details, etc.) in various exercises.  
To solve them correctly, you need a solid understanding of how networks work and how devices communicate.

The netpractice project has 10 levels, each level gives you a different nework situation to solve.
To finish them, we need to understand how network work, how to subnet and how routing work.
The asnwers for each level are saved as `.json` files.

##  Instructions

  To use the solutions provided in this repository, you will need the official file:

- **net_practice.tgz**  
  You can download it from your **42 intra**.

### Setup
1. Clone this repository **inside** the extracted directory.
2. Extract `net_practice.tgz` inside the clonded repo and make sure to pull everything inside that directory in the root of the repo.
3. Launch the exercises by opening the `index.html` or you if you have puthon3 you can:

```sh
  python3 -m http.server 8000
```

then paste this in your browser
